## Introduction
In many hospitals, the process of patient admission and management is still manual, leading to:

- Long waiting times  
- Errors in data storage  
- Difficulty in controlling costs and medicines  

The system analyzed in this project aims to:

- **Digitalize the medical examination and treatment process**  
- **Integrate web/app platforms** for patient self-registration  
- **Automate management** of medical records, prescriptions, and hospital fees  
- Ensure **transparency and accuracy** in healthcare operations

- **Backend**: Node.js / Java Spring Boot / .NET Core  
- **Database**: MySQL / PostgreSQL  
- **Deployment**: Docker + CI/CD with GitHub Actions  
- **Authentication**: OAuth2 / JWT  
- **Payment Integration**: VNPay, Momo, PayPal
